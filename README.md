# ProjectPC is a Android App designed to help users find quality, affordable PC parts.
### Overview
Project PC is the result of a problem that many people face, finding quality computer parts that wont break the bank. As a university student, I like to save money when I can. So when building my PC, I decided to see if there were cheaper alternatives on the market rather than buying new parts. Unfortunately, there was not and the only way to save money was to buy used. To do this, I went to many existing sites such as Kijiji, and eBay but found there to be no specific category where I could easily find the parts I needed. In addition, parts would often be listed incorrectly as most sellers are not educated in PC parts. ProjectPC takes the hassle and guess work out of buying used PC parts and creates a community of like minded individuals who all have teh same passion. With a few taps you can sell your old PC parts for that new motherboard. Or you can buy that graphics card you always wanted for a fraction of the price.
